# Introduction

Hello, and welcome to my Cypress playground! If you're new to my repository, I am a QA Engineer with a passion for coding and learning how to find ‚ú® all the bugs üêõüî® ‚ú®

In this project, I explore various test scenarios using Cypress + TypeScript. I explore the usage of mocks, the important of API testing and more.
